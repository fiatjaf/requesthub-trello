A Trello Power-Up that allows you to define endpoints that will receive HTTP calls, transform them using predefined jq queries and post them as comments to a card.

Trello was to be the first integration of this service, later we would create plugins for Slack, Telegram and possibly others, along with a web interface that would allow any endpoint that accepted raw HTTP calls to be targeted, but since it was rejected by the Trello Power-Up team I've moved into doing other things.
